# Full Stack Trivia API

## Introduction

This project is a trivia app that allows users to play a trivia game.

Users can:

1. See questions - both all questions and by category. Questions show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add new questions.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

Backend code follows [PEP8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

### Installing Backend Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

It is generally recommended, but not required, to use a virtual environment.

[python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server.

#### Database Setup

The database assumes an Owner 'billy'. Edit the trivia.psql file and replace 'Owner' with the name
desired.

With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:

```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

### Running the server

From within the `backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `flaskr` directs flask to use the `flaskr` directory and the `__init__.py` file to find the application.

### Testing

To run the tests, run

```
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```

### Installing Frontend Dependencies

#### Installing Node and NPM

This project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (the download includes NPM) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

#### Installing project dependencies

This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the `frontend` directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running Your Frontend in Dev Mode

The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use `npm start`. You can change the script in the `package.json` file.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

```bash
npm start
```

### Getting Started

- Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration.
- Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys.

### Error Handling

Error are returned as JSON objects in the following format

```
{
'message':'Bad request',
'error': 400,
'success':False
}
```

The API will return four error types when requests fail:

- 404
- 409
- 422
- 500

### Endpoint Library

#### Get /questions

- General:

  - Returns a list of question objects, success value, list of categories, total number of questions,
    and current catefory.
  - Results are paginated in groups of 10. Include a request argument to choose page number, starting from 1.
